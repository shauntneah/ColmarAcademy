Q1. What did you like about this project?  <br>
Ans: This was a very challenging project with a short mandated deliverable lead time, especially for someone new to coding. However, this test has laid a good foundation for me moving forward. With the completion of this website project, I am now equipped with the technical skills and knowledge base to approach most similar website development projects with confidence. Additionally, I have developed a good working habit of referring to the latest language documentations.

Q2. What did you struggle with in this project?  <br>
Ans. Personally I have a challenging time to comprehend visually and wrap my mind around the technical commands of using flex while trying to structure the code approach of building the site in my mind.


Q3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?  <br>
Ans: A better definited spec sheet would have made it easier. Certain aspects of the spec sheet was left without vital information and I had to made assumptions as I went along.

Additional Comments
-------------------
The project had not called for usage of a CDN service. However in view of a lean methodology, and the general intent of this website (i.e. no professional grade demand on web resources), I have optmized the following:
1. graphical elements with a lossless compression to effect 37% smaller files.
2. video compressionof 49% for optimized web streaming 11.1mb to 5.4mb)
